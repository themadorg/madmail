# Bug Description

**Please confirm:**
- [ ] I have checked the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/themadorg/projects/1) for known issues.

## Describe the bug
What is happening vs what should happen?

## Steps to reproduce
1. [...]
2. [...]

## Environment information
- **maddy version**: (run `maddy --version`)
- **OS**: (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04)

## Detailed Context
Since this project follows a **strict no-log policy**, the server does not generate traditional log files. Because of this, it is **CRITICAL** that you provide a very detailed explanation of:
- Exactly what you were doing when the issue occurred.
- The expected behavior vs. the actual observed behavior.
- Any error messages displayed in your client (e.g., Delta Chat).

## Configuration
- **Config**: Relevant parts of `/etc/maddy/maddy.conf` (hide sensitive data like domains if necessary, but keep the logic).
